# Discord YouTube Music Bot

A feature-rich **Discord bot** for streaming and managing **YouTube music** directly in your voice channels.  
Deployed via **Portainer**, this bot provides a simple and powerful way to play, organize, and control music through Discord commands.

## Key Features

### Music Playback
- **`!p <url>`** - Play a song or YouTube playlist.  
  The bot automatically joins your voice channel and streams high-quality audio.  
- **`!q`** - Show the current playback queue.  
- **`!s`** - Skip the currently playing song.  
- **`!sa`** - Skip all songs and clear the queue.

- **`!pl <playlist_id>`** - Play an existing memory playlist directly in your voice channel.  

Playlists are stored in memory and can easily be accessed again.


### Utility Commands
- **`!h`** â€” Display help for all available commands.  
- **`!l`** â€” Leave the current voice channel.  
- **`!r`** â€” Reboot the bot service (if hosted in docker container).  


## Under the Hood

This bot is powered by a clean, modular architecture:

- **`MusicService`** â€“ handles playback, queue management, and background prefetching for smooth transitions between songs.  
- **`YtPlaylistHandler`** â€“ fetches and parses YouTube playlists.  
- **`MemoryPlaylistHandler`** â€“ manages in-memory playlists.  
- **`MusicCog`** and **`UtilsCog`** â€“ expose commands for user interaction.

ðŸ’¡ The bot **prefetches the next song** while the current one is playing, minimizing any silence between tracks.
